\usage{
get_data(query_url, query, return_geometry)
}
\arguments{
\item{query_url}{the query url which is passed to httr::POST()}

\item{query}{the query to POST}

\item{return_geometry}{should the geometry be returned, this is passed in to query_layer & must also from part of the query}
}
\value{
either a tibble or sf object depending on return_geometry
}
\description{
Get data from an endpoint
}
\details{
This function accepts a query URL and extracts a tibble from the response.
When a returnGeometry = "false" query was used previously
get_geojson wouldn't parse the data correctly and would return an empty tibble
A new function get_tibble has been added to use a different method for requesting and parsing data
when the geometry isn't returned.
