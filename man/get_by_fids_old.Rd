\item{query}{the query to POST}

\item{my_token}{an access token acquired via \code{get_token}}

\item{return_geometry}{should the geometry be returned or just a table?}

\item{return_n}{how many features (maximum) should be returned by the query?}

\item{layer_details}{the layer details returned by the get_layer_details function}

\item{out_fields}{the fields of the layer to return (character vector)}

\description{
Get a layer by querying the FIDs
}
\details{
This function works by checking if the requested return count is less tha the max record count.
If so, it doesn't bother with getting the FIDs and just requests the data and returns it.
Getting FIDs is a big overhea so this should be avoided where possible.
